## Hey!

I'm Levi, a (https://blog.golang.org/gopher)[gopher] with an interest in Golang (could you guess?) and Python.  

My life outside programming (not my job, by the way) includes Splatoon, Medium, and Z o o m m e e t i n g s  

Think what I do is cool? Wow! Thanks! If you want to support me, just give my stuff a star on GitHub.  


Want to find me somewhere else? Check my stuff out on (https://litbelb.medium.com)[Medium] and (https://twitter.com/@butwhyt68749305)[Twitter]
