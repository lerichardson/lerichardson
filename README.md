## Hey!

I'm Levi, a [gopher](https://blog.golang.org/gopher) with an interest in Golang (could you guess?) and Python.  

My life outside programming (not my job, by the way) includes Splatoon, Medium, and Z o o m m e e t i n g s  

Think what I do is cool? Wow! Thanks! If you want to support me, just give my stuff a star on GitHub.  


Want to find me somewhere else? Check my stuff out on [Medium](https://litbelb.medium.com) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/@butwhyt68749305)
